# SolveIT - Ticketing System

Welcome to the **SolveIT** project repository! This project is being developed live on YouTube, and it's aimed at creating a fully functional ticketing system where users can submit, track, and resolve support tickets for various departments and projects within an organization.

## Project Overview

**SolveIT** is a ticketing system designed to:

- Allow users to submit support tickets to various departments or projects.
- Enable support staff to resolve issues while ensuring that higher-level employees can track progress.
- Include features like uploading files, tagging users, commenting, and closing tickets.
