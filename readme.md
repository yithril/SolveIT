# SolveIT - Ticketing System

Welcome to the **SolveIT** project repository! This project is being developed live on YouTube, and it's aimed at creating a fully functional ticketing system where users can submit, track, and resolve support tickets for various departments and projects within an organization.

## Project Overview

**SolveIT** is a ticketing system designed to:

- Allow users to submit support tickets to various departments or projects.
- Enable support staff to resolve issues while ensuring that higher-level employees can track progress.
- Include features like uploading files, tagging users, commenting, and closing tickets.
- Be prepared for internationalization, supporting multiple languages for a global company.

The project includes:

- **Backend**: Built with .NET Core using Entity Framework for database interactions.
- **Frontend**: An Angular app for the user interface.

The project is designed with scalability in mind, supporting multiple departments, global offices, and integration of role-based permissions to ensure the right people handle specific tickets.
